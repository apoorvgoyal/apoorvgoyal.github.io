<p> <br> Cities and buildings are the key energy users. With the growing globalization and urbanization, not only the city centers are becoming denser and higher, but the surrounding areas are seeing a rapid transformation in the urban morphology. The shift in this urban paradigm although is inevitable, to accommodate the growing urban population, is also leading to changes on a global scale that are irreversible, like global temperature increase and reduction in valuable sources of fossil fuels.  Thermodynamically, changes in the urban morphology changes the way the complex city system interacts with the environment and its ability to process the energy that the system exchange from the environment. The city can be considered as an open system that exchanges energy, material and information with the surrounding environment to organize itself and dissipate heat and matter. The city as a system functions by sharing and recycling the abundant solar energy that falls on the surface. (Bataille, 1991) Analyzing urban morphology can help here to understand the relation of built forms with each other and the environment. 
<br><br>Adding density in an urban area puts a negative pressure on the land as well as on resource consumption and thereby resulting in a negative feedback. <br>The negative feedback happens in variety of ways:<br><br>
•	Dissipation of absorbed solar energy from the hard surfaces (Rooftops, pavements, parking lots etc.) resulting in Urban Heat Island Effect.<br>
•	Mutual and over shadowing of surfaces. (Climate and time specific)<br>
•	Reducing the available area for modern technology to capture solar radiation (Example solar PV)<br>
•	Negatively affecting the carrying capacity of the area, thereby increasing the resource consumption<br><br><br>

Different surfaces radiated solar insolation at different wavelengths and temperature which result in altering the temperature of the surrounding environment. A mature ecosystem such as a forest process the energy available more powerfully and therefore contribute positively to the environment. The hard and dark surfaces like parking lots, or roofs absorb the energy in sunlight and dissipate it later. (Günther, n.d.)
<br><br>The absorbed solar energy that is dissipated, as a result of change urban morphology, can be termed as entropy of the urban system because it is often left as unavailable for any further useful work. Qualitatively, this unavailable energy however, possess high potential and this inefficient capturing and processing of available solar energy in the cities leads to dependence on non-renewable sources such as fossil fuels to cater to the energy demand. It would be optimal to put this exergy to work and to do this, it is important to modify the urban morphology to capture and process the available solar energy more efficiently and more powerfully. 
<br><br>The built density also affects the micro-climate in an urban area. The built performance depends heavily on the surrounding micro-climate and in order to improve the performance of individual buildings, it is therefore important to evaluate the system for used environmental energies within a larger framework than that of monthly utility bills and building efficiency. (Braham, 2010). These systems are a subset of urban morphology and effects like mutual shadow, urban heat island effects alter the micro-climate which in turn affect the built performance.
